Simple Android inventory app that allows a store to keep track of its inventory of products and track sales or shipments from suppliers. This app uses SQLite as the data storage option to store data persistently.

_This app is created as the final project of Android Basics Nanodegree program at Udacity._

**Features:**
- Add products to the database by entering the product information in the text fields.
- Add product image by capturing a photo using the camera or choose from gallery.
- Simple navigation to allow faster create, read, update, or delete operations.
- Keep track of product sales and shipment easily in a tap of a button.

**What I have learned from this project:**
- Storing information in a SQLite database.
- Storing files such as images in the device storage.
- Capturing photo using the device camera via implicit intent.
- Presenting information from files and SQLite database to the user.
- Creating implicit intents that contains stored information to other apps.
- Using TextInputLayout from design support library for better input validation.
